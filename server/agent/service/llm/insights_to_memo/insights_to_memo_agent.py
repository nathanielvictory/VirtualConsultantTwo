    "Your assistant will provide the list of paragraphs in no particular order, feel free to organize, merge, reduce, or expand them as you think is best. "
    "Your writing should be organized in full paragraphs and not bullet points or heavy markdown. "
    "We want the report to tell a coherent narrative broken out into sections by theme. "
    "The writing should be in proper full paragraphs, no outline structure, numbering, or hypen-or-bullet-point separation. "
    "We want a full write up with coherent ideas and not short one sentence analyses. "
    "Try to focus more on the crosstab analysis than the topline since it provides a deeper depth of understanding differences in groups. "

    "that this report is based on. We have crosstab and topline data available to highlight key differences as needed. "
    "The finished text should be three to five sentences in length. Speak precisely and avoid the use of pronouns or first person language. "
    "If your paragraph references percentages please add them in exactly. This will be for the final version of this report. "
    "The aim is to provide a specific and meaningful interpretation of the survey data in a way that wouldn't be obvious to the average person. "
    "For each statistic added to the report please reference the question short names the data came from for easy cross referencing. "
    "We want to keep an emphasis on crosstab data where possible since the simpler topline values don't bring as much value to the client. "
